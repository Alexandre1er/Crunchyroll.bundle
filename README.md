About
=====
This plugin provides access to the Anime and Drama video content available at Crunchyroll.com. This plugin requires the user to have a **premium** crunchyroll.com membership. You can sign up for a free 14-day trial by [clicking here](https://www.crunchyroll.com/freetrial). Free membership accounts will not work.

While this plugin is considered stable, there will always be bugs. Please submit bugs via the Github issue tracker or in the [official thread on the Plex forums](https://forums.plex.tv/t/rel-crunchyroll-plugin/38007). Feedback and/or suggestions are welcome.

End of Life notice
==================
This plugin is no longer actively maintained. It should still be fully functional, but there's no guarantee that it will continue to work.

Known Issues
============
* Watching an episode using this app does not mark it as "watched" in Plex or in the Crunchyroll queue. This is a limitation of the Plex Media Server API and there are no viable workarounds available. Hopefully Plex will update the API at some point so I can resolve this issue.


Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
**Q: I selected 1080P or 720P but the video is played in a lower resolution**

A: Not all content on Crunchyroll has HD quality videos available. This plugin will try to play content at the resolution you select. However, if a particular resolution is not available, it will play the next highest resolution available. This may also occur shortly after Crunchyroll releases a new video. Sometimes it takes Crunchyroll longer than expected to encode the HD quality videos. During this period of time the plugin only has access to the lower quality streams that have already been encoded. If this is the case, check back later and the HD quality video should be available.

**Q: How do I hide mature content?**

A: You can choose what type of content to show by changing the Mature Content Filter setting on the Crunchyroll website. Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.crunchyroll.com/acct/) and click on Video Preferences on the left side. Select the desired option from the Mature Content Filter drop down box. You should restart Plex Media Server after you've made this change.

**Q: I get a "Cannot load M3U8: crossdomain access denied" error when trying to use this plugin on Plex Web.**

A: Try un-checking the "Direct Play" box in the Plex Web settings. (Settings > Web > Player > Show Advanced > un-check Direct Play checkbox)

**Q: How do I change the subtitle language?**

A: You can configure this on the Crunchyroll website. Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.crunchyroll.com/acct/) and click on Video Preferences on the left side. Then select the desired language from the "Default Language" drop down box. This will cause all titles, descriptions, and subtitles to be displayed in that language. You should restart Plex Media Server after you've made this change.

* Optionally allow tricking CR into creating US-based session
* Use the correct Next icon in paged listings

Credits
=======
This plugin is mostly written by @MattRK, with contributions from @sander1, and later @rimas-kudelis.

The author wants to thank pgp90 and JeremySH for their awesome plugin that had kept the Plex Anime & Drama community happy for years before his own plugin was released. When he set out to help improve that plugin he had no idea that it would lead to a complete re-write of the code base.
