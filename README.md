End of Life
====
This plugin is no longer maintained. As far as i know, it's still fully functional. However, there's no guarantee that it will continue to work. I highly recommend using the official Crunchyroll apps. They all stream in HD now and are actually very good. The Windows 10 app from the Windows Store works great as do the Android & ios mobile apps. I personally use the mobile app with a Google Chromecast. It's easy, cheap, and works every time. If you don't like the official apps, you can also check out [Crunchyroll Kodi/XBMC plugin.](https://github.com/Yoshiofthewire/CrunchyXBMC)

About
=====
This plugin provides access to the Anime, Drama, and Pop video content available at Crunchyroll.com. This plugin requires the user to have a **premium** crunchyroll.com membership. You can sign up for a free 14-day trial by [clicking here](https://www.crunchyroll.com/freetrial). Free membership accounts will not work.

While this plugin is considered stable, there will always be bugs. Please submit bugs via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/MattRK/Crunchyroll.bundle/issues) or in the [official thread on the Plex forums.](https://forums.plex.tv/index.php/topic/73626-rel-crunchyroll-plugin/) I would love to hear feedback and/or suggestions. 

Requirements
============
This plugin **requires** a **premium** Crunchyroll.com account. You can sign up for free trial by [clicking here](https://www.crunchyroll.com/freetrial). When you get the plugin installed you will need to enter your username and password into the preferences section before you will be able to use it. 

* **Plex Media Server:**
	* Version 0.9.12.3 or later (http://www.plexapp.com/getplex/)
	* Windows, Mac, Linux or NAS Appliance
* **Plex Clients:**
	* Plex Home Theater
	* Roku
	* AppleTV
	* Windows 8
	* iOS, Android, & Windows Phone
	* Plex Web in Safari on Mac OSX *(Firefox & Chrome do not work, see FAQ for more info)*

Installation
============
1. Download the latest version of the plugin from [here](https://github.com/MattRK/Crunchyroll.bundle/archive/v2.2.0.zip).

2. Unzip the content into the PMS plugins directory under your user account.
	* Windows 7, Vista, or Server 2008: C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
	* Windows XP, Server 2003, or Home Server: C:\Documents and Settings\[Your Username]\Local Settings\Application Data\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins
	* Mac/Linux: ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins
	* FreeNAS: /var/db/plexdata/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins

3. Rename the unzipped folder from "Crunchyroll.bundle-vx.x.x" to "Crunchyroll.bundle"

4. Restart PMS


Known Issues
============
* Some of the Pop videos don't play correctly. This is due to the way Crunchyroll formats those URLs. They are not standardized and as such it is hard to ensure the plugin is able to handle these properly. Fortunately this is not an issue for Anime or Drama videos.  
* Watching an episode using this app does not mark it as "watched" in Plex or in the Crunchyroll queue. This is a limitation of the Plex Media Server API and there are no viable workarounds available. Hopefully Plex will update the API at some point so I can resolve this issue. 


Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
**Q: I selected 1080P or 720P but the video is played in a lower resolution**

A: Not all content on Crunchyroll has HD quality videos available. This plugin will try to play content at the resolution you select. However, if a particular resolution is not available, it will play the next highest resolution available. This may also occur shortly after Crunchyroll releases a new video. Sometimes it takes Crunchyroll longer than expected to encode the HD quality videos. During this period of time the plugin only has access to the lower quality streams that have already been encoded. If this is the case, check back later and the HD quality video should be available. 

**Q: How do I hide mature content?**

A: You can choose what type of content to show by changing the Mature Content Filter setting on the Crunchyroll website. Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.crunchyroll.com/acct/) and click on Video Preferences on the left side. Select the desired option from the Mature Content Filter drop down box. You should restart Plex Media Server after you've made this change.

**Q: I get a "Cannot load M3U8: crossdomain access denied" error when trying to use this plugin on Plex Web.**

A: Using this plugin on Plex Web does not "officially" work in any browser but Safari on a Mac OSX. However, some users have had success by un-checking the "Direct Play" box in the Plex Web settings. (Settings > Web > Player > Show Advanced > un-check Direct Play checkbox) 

**Q: How do I change the subtitle language?**

A: You can configure this on the Crunchyroll website. Go to your [Account Settings](https://www.crunchyroll.com/acct/) and click on Video Preferences on the left side. Then select the desired language from the "Default Language" drop down box. This will cause all titles, descriptions, and subtitles to be displayed in that language. You should restart Plex Media Server after you've made this change.

Credits
=======
I want to thank pgp90 and JeremySH for their awesome plugin that has kept the Plex Anime & Drama community happy for the past few years. When I set out to help improve that plugin I had no idea that it would lead to a complete re-write of the code base.
